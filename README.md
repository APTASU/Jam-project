# Deliverables
## The pitch
"Peanut Butter Apocalypse" is a video game where you play as the jam hero, tasked with defeating an army of peanut butter monsters. The game is fast-paced and filled with action, as you fight through different levels to save the world. The monsters come in different shapes and sizes, each with their own unique abilities and strengths, so you'll need to be quick and use strategy to defeat them all.
As you progress through the game, the monsters become more difficult to beat, but you'll also have the chance to get stronger. By winning battles, you'll earn rewards and unlock new weapons, power-ups, and abilities to help you in your fight. It won't be easy, but with each victory, you'll be one step closer to saving the world from the peanut butter apocalypse.
If you're up for the challenge, get ready to jump into the fight. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders, so use all your skills to defeat the peanut butter monsters and emerge victorious. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking for a fun, action-packed adventure, "Peanut Butter Apocalypse" is the game for you!
